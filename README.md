# Overview

[Personal site](https://edmudo.github.io/) built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme with a few modifications (see `tmpl/al-folio` branch).

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
